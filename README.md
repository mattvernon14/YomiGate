YomiGate is a Python CLI tool for practicing Japanese kanji
readings by typing the correct hiragana.

It uses a local SQLite database to store vocabulary and track 
attempts, and it can optionally generate example sentences using
a local LLM (LM Studio). If no LLM is running, the program still
works normally.
